# hashComparisons

During my masters of cyber security we were asked to compare some hash algorithms. I decided to quickly run some time-based comparisons in python that would measure how long it would take a few different algorithms to hash a constant file. These are fairly naive and likely unfair comparisons and were just a quick way to get some initial metrics.
